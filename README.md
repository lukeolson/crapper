Crappy: A basic C++ wrapper for python

Crappy attempts to take a very limited form of C++ templates and wrap them in an
easy way for Python.  It uses/modifies/simplifies/complicates the `sparsetools`
structure in `scipy.sparse`: [https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/master/scipy/sparse](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/master/scipy/sparse)

How it works
---
  - you make a templated function like the following
```C++
// y += a*x
template <class I, class T>
void axpy(const I n, const T a, const T * x, T * y){
    for(I i = 0; i < n; i++){
        y[i] += a * x[i];
    }
}
```
  - use template classes from a specified list
    - i:  integer scalar
    - I:  integer array
    - T:  data array
    - \*: indicates that the next argument is an output argument
    - v:  void
  - crappy will
    - inspect the header file for your funciton and parse it for types
    - create an implementation header for an array of i-types and t-types for `numpy`
    - create a wrapped `.cxx` file for the header file
    - build a Python module with calls to these templates

What it doesn't do
---

First of all this is fairly limited as the name suggests!  It doesn't check anything for errors and it doesn't do anything fancy with the templates.  It could do STL vectors, but doesn't at the moment.

Usage
---
  - coming...this is going to be a drop in

Differences from `sparsetools` in `scipy.sparse`
---
  - `sparsetools` uses a set spec list such as 'viIITT' whereas `crappy` generates this
  - `t` types (or double scalars) are now supported
  - the `.cxx` file is autogenerated
  - it extends beyond just tools for sparse methods, so some method names reflect this
  - it's meant to be dropped into your code
