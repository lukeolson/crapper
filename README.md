Crappy: A basic C++ wrapper for python

Crappy attempts to take a very limited form of C++ templates and wrap them in an
easy way for Python.  It uses/modifies/simplifies/complicates the `sparsetools`
structure in `scipy.sparse`: https://github.com/scipy/scipy/blob/master/scipy/sparse

How it works

  - coming

What it doesn't do
---
  - first of all it's fairly limited at the name suggests

Usage

  - coming...

Differences from sparsetools
---
  - `sparsetools` uses a set spec list such as 'viIITT' whereas `crappy` generates this
  - `t` types (or double scalars) are now supported
  - the `.cxx` file is autogenerated
  - it extends beyond just tools for sparse methods, so some method names reflect this
  - it's meant to be dropped into your code
